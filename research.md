#### Current Research Interests: 

On the unification of System Identification, Control Theory, Optimization and Machine Learning with applications to the understanding and (re-)design of natural and man-made systems. In particular, I have been working on the hyrbid dynamical systems identification problem and focusing on biology and power systems as motivating applications.
